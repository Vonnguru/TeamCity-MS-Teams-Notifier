Version 0.9.1
* Bug: Update by Atlassian of the HipChat API broke the retrieval of emoticons (#53).

Version 0.9.0
* Enhancement: TeamCity 9 compatibility, specifically v9.0.2 (#44).
* Bug: Loading emoticons causes an infinite loop, due to un-RESTful HipChat API (#49).
* Feature: New build statistics message template variables (#45): 
           `${noOfTests}`, `${noOfPassedTests}`, `${noOfFailedTests}`, 
           `${noOfNewFailedTests}`, `${noOfIgnoredTests}` and 
           `${durationOfTests}`. Other build statistics, e.g. custom 
           defined statistics, code duplicates, code coverage, etc. 
           can be referenced in a template with the `stats.` prefix 
           within the data model, e.g. `${.data_model["stats.myKey"]}`. 
           The exact variables will vary, so enable debug logging to 
           see what's available in your environment.
* Feature: Proxy support (#46).

       since TeamCity 8 (#30, #31).

       the templates) can cause a 404 on some setups because of 
       request limits (#26, #27).

               build after a failure, or first failed build after a 
               successful build (#21).

* Bug: Unicode notification message payloads weren't sent as 
       UTF-8 (#20).
* Bug: Race condition during plugin initialisation (during server 
       startup) that sometimes prevented emoticons from being 
       cached (#25).
* Enhancement: Configurable notification message templates.
* Enhancement: In addition to configurable templates, any build or 
               agent parameter can now be referenced too (#16).
* Enhancement: Switched from JUnit to TestNG, added EMMA for code 
               coverage analysis and lint4j for static analysis, with 
               the result that 722 out of 727 lines (99%) are now 
               tested.

Version 0.3.1
* Bug: Project configuration tab didn't use room ID aliases when 
       inheriting from the default or parent configuration. 

Version 0.3.0 

* Feature: Disable or enable build and server events. 

Version 0.2.0 

* Feature: Allow setting different rooms for different projects, and 
           allow to use the default configuration or none, or inherit 
           from the parent project. As a consequence, server up and 
           down events are sent to only the default room, if 
           configured.
* Improvement: Instead of entering a room ID, it can now be selected 
               from a dropdown list of available rooms.
* Improvement: Added a button on the configuration page to test the 
               API credentials.
* Bug: Fixed UI bug where disabling the plugin after saving settings 
       didn't respond.

Version 0.1.0

* First release.
